### Explainable Anomaly Detection & Decision Intelligence for Smart Buildings

An end-to-end **AI-powered energy intelligence system** that detects abnormal energy consumption patterns in smart buildings and converts machine learning outputs into **explainable, actionable business decisions**.

Unlike traditional anomaly detection projects, this system goes beyond detection to provide **AI reasoning, risk escalation analysis, priority scoring, and ROI-driven insights** through an interactive dashboard.

##  Problem Statement

Smart buildings generate massive time-series energy data.  
Abnormal energy usage often indicates:
- Equipment faults
- Energy wastage
- Operational inefficiencies

Traditional monitoring systems either:
- Miss subtle anomalies, or  
- Detect anomalies without explaining *why* they occurred or *what to do next*.

This project addresses that gap by building an **Explainable AI (XAI) decision intelligence system**.
